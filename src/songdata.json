(Brickfield Nights)/&Every night we'd meet at the same place same time.../&Late nights spent kicking round a football/&We carved our initials on the school wall/&Remember those Brickfield Nights/&Remember those Brickfield Nights/&It seems so long, those days are gone/&Dark nights down Brickfield/&On summer nights like a sauna/&We always met by the corner light... (Brickfield Nights)/&Then the girls came with their long hair/&High heels and the make up never quite right... (Brickfield Nights)/&Every night we'd meet at the same place same time.../&Saturdays at the local dance hall/&They carved our initials on the school wall/&Remember those Brickfield Nights/&Remember those Brickfield Fights/&It seems so long, those days are gone/&Dark nights down Brickfield/&Remember those Brickfield Nights/&Remember those Brickfield Fights/&It seems so long, those days are gone/&Dark nights down Brickfield"
